# AnimeWatch CLI App

This is a simple app that lets you watch anime episodes from [AnimeWatch](https://animewat.ch/) using mpv, without having to download them.

## Installation

If you are using Windows, you can just use the .exe in the [release page](https://github.com/RaulRohjans/animewatch-cli/releases/tag/V1.0).

To use this app you MUST have [python](https://www.python.org/) installed.

```bash
cd project_dir
pip install -r requirements.exe
```

## Usage

If you are on Windows, simply double click the .exe file. Otherwise do

```bash
python main.py
```

Upon running the program a folder name "config" is created. This is where you can choose to change the MPV path (Windows only) and use the one installed in your system, leaving it to default will use the portable player included in the folder.

## Contributing
Pull requests and feature requests are welcome, as the program is very simple and might use some improvements.
Please be patient as I might take a while to review the code or answer issues due to short time.
